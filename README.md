# Effects of Algae Density on Invertebrate Density in the Rocky Intertidal

## EDS222 - Final Project

Repository containing all code and output for the final project in class EDS 222 of the MEDS program - Statistics for Environmental Data Science. This project focuses on investigating the causal relationships between algae density on the number of invertebrates found along the rocky intertidal zones of southern Alaska using common statistical methods.

## Data

Data were obtained through the [USGS ScienceBase Catalog](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/63346649d34e900e86c69f6f). Data are a part of the Gulf Watch Alaska (GWA) long-term monitoring program rocky intertidal study.
